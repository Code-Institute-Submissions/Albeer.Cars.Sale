##### *Full Stack project :  Frameworks with Django Milestone Project*
###### This project is designed in a simple and user-friendly way enabling the customer to browse and purchase in a very easy way
***

# UX

##### My goal in this project is clear: selling cars, earning money from them, enabling the user to see cars and details for each car, searching through the car model, adding the car to the shopping basket, and then paying the amount, and no user can pay the amount except that he logs in or registers as a new user.

###### This project is designed in a very easy way so that the site can be used by all different societal groups and all ages.

# Deployment

- The project was written by gitpod and a storage was created by github and the code was push to <a href="https://github.com/albeeralkhawri/Albeer.Cars.Sale">here</a>
- The project has been published and hosted by heroku <a href="https://albeer-cars-sale.herokuapp.com/">here</a>

### Take the next steps for publication:
- Create file requirements.text has the necessary dependencies to run the project
- Create env.py file containing security variants and add it to .gitignore to avoid posting it in github
- Create a new repository in github
- Created a Heroku app with a albeer-cars-sale name
- Connected Heroku app  with github repository and enabled automatic deploys
- Adjust Postgres database settings with project
- I stored the variables in env.py and put them in Reveal Config Vars to enable heroku to read the variables
- Run python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate after adding the data link
- Added the albeer-cars-sale.herokuapp.com to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py file
- Add the Procfile required by Heroku

### Repository site link (https://github.com/albeeralkhawri/Albeer.Cars.Sale)
### The live display link (https://albeer-cars-sale.herokuapp.com/)

## The step of local Deployment

- Project cloning from <a herf="https://github.com/albeeralkhawri/Albeer.Cars.Sale">here</a>
- Create a new workspace and add a project file to workspace
- Install python3 on your workspace
- Install requirements.txt, pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Install the required dependencies
- Add default variables like secret code and others to a file env.py
- Set the SQLite database to be used for development mode and the PostgreSQL database for deployment
- Run python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate to make database
- For databaes start python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb 
- Use the following command to create a super user python3 manage.py createsuperuser
